## How to configure
Place a mp3 file into sounds/ and add it to sounds.json.

Example:
```JSON
{
    "\<category\>": [
        {
            "sound": "\<the name of your mp3 file\>",
            "text": "\<a label for the soundboard button\>",
            "color": "\<a color from type red, blue, yellow, green\>"
        }
    ]
}
```
